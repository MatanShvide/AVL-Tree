# AVL-Tree

First of two projects in Data Structures course 0368-2158 in my first semester of my second year

We were required to execute an AVL Tree in Java

I also created a tester for myself which inputs random values into the structure and checks if the final tree meets all of the AVL Tree requirements

Final Grade: 85
